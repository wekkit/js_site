      <p>This module aims to introduce students to the subject of Japanese studies from a multi-disciplinary approach. It has three main components. The first component is humanities, covering art, philosophy, history and literature. The second component is social sciences, which includes sociology, anthropology, politics and economics. The third component is linguistics and language development. Students will learn about the methods and theories the various disciplines contribute to the study of Japan. Audio-visual materials, fieldwork, guest lectures, study tours, projects and debates will supplement lecture and tutorials.</p>

      <p>This is an introductory Japanese linguistics module which teaches how the language is analysed in terms of its sound, grammar and meaning. In order to develop a deeper understanding of the language, students will be asked to do frequent exercises that will help develop analytical skills. Topics such as pronunciation, accent patterns, word-formation, sentence analysis, complex sentences, functions of language, comparison with other Asian languages, and literal and pragmatic meanings will also be taught.</p>

      <p>This module deals with modern and contemporary literary works. It aims to develop an awareness not only of the different literary genres and literary theories, but also of the aspirations and frustrations of post-war writers as they struggled to reconcile the Japanese tradition with the Western impact. Both important authors and literary movements will be considered. Writings of contemporary women writers will also be read.</p>

      <p>This module provides an introduction to popular culture in contemporary Japan. From the study of various Japanese cultural forms and practices, it explores the linkages between particular practices and subcultures on the one hand, and larger societal trends on the other. The course emphasises hands-on learning and expects students to engage in first-hand material gathering and observations. The goal will be to use studies of Japanese popular culture forms to expand critical thinking about globalisation, gender roles, race, nationalism in Japan and beyond.</p>

      <p>Images are as important as ideas in defining and transmitting cultural patterns, and neither can be understood without exploring the other. This module attempts to look into the core of Japanese culture to understand the ideas that have been used to define Japanese culture and the connections these ideas have with images. Topics covered include Japanese aesthetic ideals, ethical paradigms, festivals, and visual arts. Through project work students will be encouraged to engage themselves creatively in exploring a specific aspect of Jaapnese culture, art, aesthetics or design that they find interesting.</p>

      <p>This course provides an introduction to basic gender and feminist theories through a comparative examination of Japanese and other cultures. We begin by interrogating the ways that the terms "male" and "female" have been defined variously using biological, social, legal and political criteria. Using selected historical, literary and ethnographic examples as case studies, we examine the discourses pertaining to the use of these categories as both the process and consequence of unequal distribution of power within society. Through debate and discussion, students will gain a deeper understanding of the variation and mutability of gender and sexual discourse as a social, rather than purely ontological, construct.</p>

The formation of Japan’s modern and imperial culture was inseparable from its colonial experience in Korea: conversely, modernity in Korea was formed under Japanese colonialism.

This course deals with this question through an examination of social groups in contemporary Japan which by choice or circumstance fall out of the mainstream. Topics will include ethnic minorities, homosexuals, criminals, religious cult members, people with HIV/AIDS, the homeless, and others. By drawing upon the experiences of these alternatives lives, students will be asked to generate their own theories on the process of social differentiation and the production of cultural identity in contemporary Japan.

      <p>Many Japanese literary works have been adapted into films, often with new interpretations. Students will do comparative readings/viewings of these works, paying special attention to the unique characteristics of each genre, and their thematic concerns. One of the key concerns in these works is the ascription and representation of gender (often female, occasionally male) roles. Works with prominent gender themes including Abe Kôbô's Women in the Dunes will be studied as a means to critically examine the gender discourse in modern Japan , as well as other pertinent issues such as alienation, identity, and history which are often part of the discursive construction of gender.</p>

      <p>This module is designed to familiarise students with the rich world of Japanese art, utilising the excellent collection of Japanese art books in the Japanese Resources Section of the library. Slide photographs of selected works will be shown and discussed in class. Approximately equal time will be spent on (1) ancient and medieval art and sculpture, (2) arts of the early modern period, and (3) modern artistic trends since the Meiji Restoration. The aim is to deepen students' appreciation of Japanese art by considering historical contexts, discussing the ideas and feelings conveyed by the art, and probing the aesthetic and philosophical concepts behind the art.</p>

      <p>With the ongoing stagnation of the Japanese economy in the 1990s, the very Japanese management which has been hailed in the past as a cornerstone of Japan's economic success has today become an issue of much debate. This module takes up this debate with an emphasis on the core area of Japanese management, the management of human resources. After outlining the features of management in Japan, the module critically assesses these features over time and from different perspectives. Besides targeting students interested in Japan the module also welcomes students that are interested in critically discussing national differences in management systems in general.</p>

      <p>This module explores the fascinating relationship between humans and environment in Japan. We will use Japan to think about how we humans should interact with and treat the precious environment that sustains us. We will consider the topic from a variety of disciplinary perspectives including myths, literature and thought, popular culture, architecture and art, politics, economy, law, environmentalism, and social movements. The module will be of value to any students who have an interest in the environment, Japan, or both. Students will leave the module not only with knowledge about Japan, but hopefully, greater sensitivity to the challenges facing humankind today.</p>

      <p>Entrepreneurship is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of a country's economy. However, Japan has been described as a collectivist society where individual initiative is not appreciated and where it was often the government that led economic development. Yet, Japan has produced a number of extraordinary individuals who played an important role in shaping its economy. Through a series of case studies of dynamic and colourful entrepreneurship the module aims to identify the forces underlying entrepreneurship in Japan, thereby creating a general understanding of the interaction between the individual and its economic, political and social environment.</p>

The issues and themes to be focused on vary each semester, but they include, for example, the use of communication strategies in contemporary Japanese, societal hierarchy and language, the relationships between gender and language use, and Japanese socio-cultural values as reflected in language. The approach of this module is multi-disciplinary in that the insights will be drawn from Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, Literature, Psychology and Media Studies as necessary. Students reading this module will conduct research projects in which literature and data are collected and analysed to be written up as a report in English. Use of the Internet to communicate with students doing similar projects in universities abroad will also be explored.</p>

      <p>This module traces the historical development of Japan from the mid 19th century to the present. It focuses on close reading and discussion of important English-language works with particular emphasis on historical and theoretical controversies in the field. Students will be encouraged to think about both the modern history of Japan as well as the historians who have claimed to reconstruct and narrate it. The module is aimed at students interested in the intersection between Japanese history, the practice of historiography, and the application of theoretical models to the past.</p>

      <p>Starting with an introduction of poetry, an important component in the literary scene especially in the realm of court literature, various other genres, including tales (monogatari), memoirs, noh and kabuki, will be examined in this module. With reference to critical works of contemporary scholars both in Japan and the West, different issues and concerns pertaining to these categories of works will be identified and discussed in the seminars. Topics include the relationship among these genres and poetry, the significance of women's writings in the Heian court, and the metamorphosis of performance genre through the ages and its implications. Various forms of texts, such as scroll paintings, films, documentaries and music will be used. The aim of the course is twofold: firstly, to expose students to some representative literary works in the canon; and secondly, to situate these texts in a post-modern framework so as to provide a more relevant and interesting reading.</p><p>

      <p>This module aims to promote the better understanding about Japan's foreign policy and international relations. The module consists of three analytical focuses: defence and security policies, foreign economic policy and regional and multilateral institutions. The first section highlights major features of Japan's defence and security policies including the recent changes in Japan's security environment in the Asia Pacific region and their impact on Japan's defence policy approaches. The second section focuses on the characteristics of Japan's policies of international trade and foreign aid. This section also discusses the domestic system in the context of Japan's foreign economic policy and highlights how the Western critics regarded the issue as problematic. The third section examines Japan's approaches to regional institutions such as APEC, ARF, ASEAN+3, and the G8 Summit Meeting and United Nations, with focuses on its approaches and diplomatic activities in each case. Although this module highlights more empirical cases of Japanese foreign policy, it also introduces some theoretical debates as well.</p>

The module will review major research on Japan's political economy written from historical, theoretical and comparative perspectives. By exploring the changing international images of Japan in the field of political economy, the module aims to highlight: the role of the government in Japan's high postwar economic growth and features of its industrial policy-making processes; the relevance of high growth in other East Asian economies in comparison to the Japanese case; the different schools of thought on Japan's economic policy and the evolution of US-Japan trade friction in the 1980s; and Japan's approaches to and initiatives in deregulation in the 1990s.</p>

      <p>This module challenges the foundation of human knowledge. Examining cultural icons from Japan's past and present we will unpack the assumptions, stereotypes, narrative strategies, and visualising techniques of representing Japan. Students will probe one or more of Japan 's three famous cultural icons - the samurai, the geisha, and/or the yakuza - as they appear in literature, visual and performance arts, and academic writings. By the end of the module students will not only have a richer understanding of the “realities” behind such icons, but more significantly, they will be equipped to challenge stereotypes of Japan presented by journalism, popular culture, and the humanistic and social sciences. Ultimately such discovery will lead students to question their own knowledge of self and other. Students should refer to the module IVLE page for details of the selected icon(s) for the current semester.</p>

      <p>Humans have always actively borrowed from other cultures. Such borrowing is a creative process which influences aspects of life ranging from basic material needs to aesthetic appreciation. Often, however, cultural borrowing is labelled as simple imitation. This results in cultural stereotypes that impede understanding of other cultures. Using Chinese and Japanese cultural borrowings as illustration, this module teaches second and third year students to analyse the creative process of cultural exchange. By developing theoretical perspectives from the study of China and Japan, students will learn about exchanges among culture in general.</p>

      <p>Few words in the English language (or any language) are as evocative and emotionally-charged as “home.” But how do we determine what we call home, and why should we take “home” seriously? This module explores the political, social, economic, and cultural aspects of the complex idea of home. Major topics include: sense of place, home technologies and design, gender and housework, home and travel, globalisation, nationalism, homelessness, exile, and representations of home. Students will complete the module with a new appreciation for the complexity of the places – house, neighbourhood, nation, planet – they call home.</p>

      <p>Consumption has come to dominate our lives, is driving economies, yet also endangering the future of our planet. This module asks questions about consumption from multiple perspectives, such as how did consumption assume its prominent place, how do economists rationalise consumption, how do companies use behavioural models to craft marketing strategies, whether consumption is good or bad for society or the individual, or whether consumers need to be protected. Participants in this module will explore how different disciplines approach such questions and will have the opportunity to reflect on their own consumption practices and impact on the social and physical environment.</p>
