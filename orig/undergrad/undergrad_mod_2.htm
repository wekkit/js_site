        This module aims to introduce students to the subject of Japanese studies from a 
  multi-disciplinary approach. It has three main components. The first component 
  is humanities, covering art, philosophy, history and literature. The second 
  component is social sciences, which includes sociology, anthropology, politics 
  and economics. The third component is linguistics and language development.

  language is analysed in terms of its sound, grammar and meaning. In order to 
  develop a deeper understanding of the language, students will be asked to do 
  frequent exercises that will help develop analytical skills. Topics such as 
  pronunciation, accent patterns, word-formation, sentence analysis, complex 
  sentences, functions of language, comparison with other Asian languages, and 
  literal and pragmatic meanings will also be taught.</div></th>

        Images are as important as ideas in defining and transmitting cultural patterns, 
  and neither can be understood without exploring the other. This module attempts 
  to look into the core of Japanese culture to understand the ideas that have been 
  used to define Japanese culture and the connections these ideas have with 
  images. Topics covered include Japanese aesthetic ideals, ethical paradigms, 
  festivals, and visual arts. Through project work students will be encouraged to 
  engage themselves creatively in exploring a specific aspect of Jaapnese culture, 
  art, aesthetics or design that they find interesting.</div></th>

        This module explores the organisation of Japanese business and industries. To do 
  so, the module looks at the various players in the Japanese economy and their 
  relationships. In exploring the organisation of Japanese business, the module 
  employs a problem-based learning approach. Students will work in teams and will 
  look at the Japanese economy from a variety of perspectives, i.e. those of the 
  Japanese and foreign governments, domestic and foreign businesses, small and 
  large enterprises, or enterprises from different industries such as 
  manufacturing, retailing, and finance. The modules focuses on students 
  interested in Japan, but also on those wanting to actively bring together 
  interdisciplinary knowledge through the study of Japanese business.</div></th>

                                This course provides an introduction to basic gender and feminist theories 
through a comparative examination of Japanese and other cultures. We begin by 
interrogating the ways that the terms "male" and "female" have been defined variously using biological, social, legal and political criteria. Using selected historical, literary and ethnographic examples as case studies, we examine the discourses pertaining to the use of these categories as both the process and consequence of unequal distribution of power within society. Through debate and discussion, students will gain a deeper understanding of the variation and mutability of gender and sexual discourse as a social, rather than purely ontological, construct.</div></th>

        This module surveys the fascinating development of Japanese civilisation from 
  prehistoric times to the present. Throughout our journey we will investigate and 
  answer key questions about this intriguing civilisation. Where did the Japanese 
  come from? What forces shaped Japanese society? How has Japan changed and 
  interacted with the world? Rather than simple facts, the module will focus on 
  processes and problems throughout Japanese history. Our aim will be to answer 
  critical questions about the country. The module is for students of all 
  disciplinary backgrounds who are interested in thinking about Japan.</div></th>

                                This module exposes students to country and culture of Japan using food as its analytic focal point. In the section on historical, political and economic perspectives, students will uncover the ways that food in Japan influences state policies, creates international conflicts and contributes to the formation of national identity. In the section on socio-cultural perspectives, students will learn to evaluate the ways that food creates meaning in such realms as language, education, media programming, and religious practices. Concepts covered in this course will be applicable to a broad range of phenomenon outside of Japan and outside the topic of food. </p>

                                Japan  and Southeast Asia share a complex history of interactions. Looking at issues  such as early migration and trade relationships, the occupation during the  Pacific War, production networks, development aid and free trade agreements, or  the enthusiastic reception of Japanese products including anime, television  drama and food allow us to build an understanding of the dynamics of  relationships in Asia. This will be done by first introducing the key issues  and then focusing on either popular culture, international business,  international relations, or Japanese migration to different regions of  Southeast Asia. The module will be complemented by a fieldtrip  to Southeast Asia.<br />

                                From the fifth century onwards, Japan has had an intricate and at times conflicting relationship with Korea. The formation of Japan’s modern and imperial culture was inseparable from its colonial experience in Korea: conversely, modernity in Korea was formed under Japanese colonialism. This module aims at understanding historical interrelations between Japan and Korea during colonial and postcolonial times by focusing on issues of modernity, national identity, cultural politics, and globalisation. It uses various official and popular cultural forms such as museums, expositions, art, film, anime, TV drama, and international events to study the intertwined histories between these two countries.<br />

In order to enhance students' understanding of the analytical skills/tools, students will do frequent exercises on the language from many different points of view. Topics such as lexicography, pragmatics, socio-linguistics and historical linguistics may also be introduced.</div></th>

  national characteristics, what does it mean to be different? This course deals 
  with this question through an examination of social groups in contemporary Japan 
  which by choice or circumstance fall out of the mainstream. Topics will include 
  ethnic minorities, homosexuals, criminals, religious cult members, people with 
  HIV/AIDS, the homeless, and others. By drawing upon the experiences of these 
  alternatives lives, students will be asked to generate their own theories on the 
  process of social differentiation and the production of cultural identity in

  supplemented by a historical perspective focusing on the samurai heritage and 
  the ideas behind the Meiji Restoration. No knowledge of the Japanese language or 
  of specialised scholarly vocabulary is required or expected.</div></th>

        Many Japanese literary works have been adapted into films, often with new 
  interpretations. Students will do comparative readings/viewings of these works, 
  paying special attention to the unique characteristics of each genre, and their 
  thematic concerns. One of the key concerns in these works is the ascription and 
  representation of gender (often female, occasionally male) roles. Works with 
  prominent gender themes including Abe Kôbô's <EM>Women in the Dunes </EM>will be studied as a means to critically examine the gender discourse in modern Japan , as well as other pertinent issues such as alienation, identity, and history which are often part of the discursive construction of gender.</div></th>

        This module is designed to familiarise students with the rich world of Japanese 
  art, utilising the excellent collection of Japanese art books in the Japanese 
  Resources Section of the library. Slide photographs of selected works will be 
  shown and discussed in class. Approximately equal time will be spent on (1) 
  ancient and medieval art and sculpture, (2) arts of the early modern period, and 
  (3) modern artistic trends since the Meiji Restoration. The aim is to deepen 
  students' appreciation of Japanese art by considering historical contexts, 
  discussing the ideas and feelings conveyed by the art, and probing the aesthetic 
  and philosophical concepts behind the art.</div></th>

        With the ongoing stagnation of the Japanese economy in the 1990s, the very 
  Japanese management which has been hailed in the past as a cornerstone of 
  Japan's economic success has today become an issue of much debate. This module 
  takes up this debate with an emphasis on the core area of Japanese management, 
  the management of human resources. After outlining the features of management in 
  Japan, the module critically assesses these features over time and from 
  different perspectives. Besides targeting students interested in Japan the 
  module also welcomes students that are interested in critically discussing 
  national differences in management systems in general.</div></th>

patterns in media texts; and interrogate notions of transnational cultural flow 
using Japan's popular media as a case stduy. Lectures will draw on materials 
from TV archives, magazines, comics, news articles and film footage, and other 
media-related sources. Tutorials will be conducted in "workshop" style in which stduents will be expected to work with first hand Japanese media materials.</div></th>

        This module explores the fascinating relationship between humans and environment 
  in Japan. We will use Japan to think about how we humans should interact with 
  and treat the precious environment that sustains us. We will consider the topic 
  from a variety of disciplinary perspectives including myths, literature and 
  thought, popular culture, architecture and art, politics, economy, law, 
  environmentalism, and social movements. The module will be of value to any 
  students who have an interest in the environment, Japan, or both. Students will 
  leave the module not only with knowledge about Japan, but hopefully, greater 
  sensitivity to the challenges facing humankind today.</div></th>

        Entrepreneurship is one of the main factors determining the dynamics of a 
  country's economy. However, Japan has been described as a collectivist society 
  where individual initiative is not appreciated and where it was often the 
  government that led economic development. Yet, Japan has produced a number of 
  extraordinary individuals who played an important role in shaping its economy. 
  Through a series of case studies of dynamic and colourful entrepreneurship the 
  module aims to identify the forces underlying entrepreneurship in Japan, 
  thereby creating a general understanding of the interaction between the 
  individual and its economic, political and social environment.</div></th>

 This module analyses the movement of people in Japan for both work and play from a range of disciplines. Major topics include domestic and international labour migration; the impacts of gender, class, ethnicity, and nationality on mobility; the politics and economics of mobility vs. native place; transnational mobility; transportation networks; and domestic and international tourism. The module introduces students to a range of historical and contemporary issues through the theoretical lens of mobility, providing them with not only a comprehensive understanding of the importance of human mobility within Japan, but also the theoretical background to apply their knowledge beyond Japan.

        This module explores how contemporary Japanese language and its use reflects 
  Japanese society and culture. The issues and themes to be focused on vary each 
  semester, but they include, for example, the use of communication strategies in 
  contemporary Japanese, societal hierarchy and language, the relationships 
  between gender and language use, and Japanese socio-cultural values as reflected 
  in language. The approach of this module is multi-disciplinary in that the 
  insights will be drawn from Linguistics, Sociology, Anthropology, Literature, 
  Psychology and Media Studies as necessary. Students reading this module will 
  conduct research projects in which literature and data are collected and 
  analysed to be written up as a report in English. Use of the Internet to 
  communicate with students doing similar projects in universities abroad will 
  also be explored.</div></th>

 This module traces the historical development of Japan from the mid 19th century to the present. It focuses on close reading and discussion of important English-language works with particular emphasis on historical and theoretical controversies in the field. Students will be encouraged to think about both the modern history of Japan as well as the historians who have claimed to reconstruct and narrate it. The module is aimed at students interested in the intersection between Japanese history, the practice of historiography, and the application of theoretical models to the past.

        Starting with an introduction of poetry, an important component in the literary 
  scene especially in the realm of court literature, various other genres, 
  including tales (monogatari), memoirs, noh and kabuki, will be examined in this 
  module. With reference to critical works of contemporary scholars both in Japan 
  and the West, different issues and concerns pertaining to these categories of 
  works will be identified and discussed in the seminars. Topics include the 
  relationship among these genres and poetry, the significance of women's writings 
  in the Heian court, and the metamorphosis of performance genre through the ages 
  and its implications. Various forms of texts, such as scroll paintings, films, 
  documentaries and music will be used. The aim of the course is twofold: firstly, 
  to expose students to some representative literary works in the canon; and 
  secondly, to situate these texts in a post-modern framework so as to provide a 
  more relevant and interesting reading.</div></th>

  Japan's defence and security policies including the recent changes in Japan's 
  security environment in the Asia Pacific region and their impact on Japan's 
  defence policy approaches. The second section focuses on the characteristics of 
  Japan's policies of international trade and foreign aid. This section also 
  discusses the domestic system in the context of Japan's foreign economic policy 
  and highlights how the Western critics regarded the issue as problematic. The 
  third section examines Japan's approaches to regional institutions such as APEC, 
  ARF, ASEAN+3, and the G8 Summit Meeting and United Nations, with focuses on its 
  approaches and diplomatic activities in each case. Although this module 
  highlights more empirical cases of Japanese foreign policy, it also introduces 
  some theoretical debates as well.</div></th>

        This module is designed to promote students' understanding of some of the 
  salient features of Japan's political economy, especially the roles of 
  politicians and bureaucrats in the conduct of industrial and foreign economic 
  policy. The module will review major research on Japan's political economy 
  written from historical, theoretical and comparative perspectives. By exploring 
  the changing international images of Japan in the field of political economy, 
  the module aims to highlight: the role of the government in Japan's high postwar 
  economic growth and features of its industrial policy-making processes; the 
  relevance of high growth in other East Asian economies in comparison to the 
  Japanese case; the different schools of thought on Japan's economic policy and 
  the evolution of US-Japan trade friction in the 1980s; and Japan's approaches to 
  and initiatives in deregulation in the 1990s.</div></th>

        This module is designed to enhance students' understanding of contemporary Japan 
  from a geographical perspective. Japanese cities and regions are thought to be 
  going through a period of transition influenced by wider socio-economic forces 
  of globalisation. Major topics covered in the module include industrial 
  restructuring and factory relocation to Asia, creation of new urban industries, 
  urban social change such as residential segregation and homelessness, popular 
  culture and urban consumption, new economic immigrants and ethnic minorities. As 
  this module can be read by both JS and Geography students, basic knowledge of 
  either contemporary Japanese society, or social/economic change of Asian cities

 This module introduces students to basic translation theory while simultaneously engaging them in actual translation exercises. Various texts will be used in these exercises, including literary and academic texts, writings in businesses and popular culture, newspaper articles, etc. The objective of this course is twofold: to deepen students' understanding of cultural differences manifested in Japanese and English writings, and to train students' translation skills.</p>

        The Independent Study Module is designed to enable the student to explore an 
  approved topic within the discipline in depth. The student should approach a 
  lecturer to work out an agreed topic, readings, and assignments for the module. 
  A formal, written agreement is to be drawn up, giving a clear account of the 
  topic, programme of study, assignments, evaluation, and other pertinent details. 
  Head's and/or Honours Coordinator's approval of the written agreement is 
  required. Regular meetings and reports are expected. Evaluation is based on 100% 
  Continuous Assessment and must be worked out between the student and the 
  lecturer prior to seeking departmental approval.</div></th>

                              This module aims to introduce students to the subject of Japanese studies from a 
                              multi-disciplinary approach. It has three main components. The first component 
                              is humanities, covering art, philosophy, history and literature. The second 
                              component is social sciences, which includes sociology, anthropology, politics 
                              and economics. The third component is linguistics and language development. 
                              Students will learn about the methods and theories the various disciplines 
                              contribute to the study of Japan. Audio-visual materials, fieldwork, guest 
                              lectures, study tours, projects and debates will supplement lecture and 
                              tutorials.</div></th>

                              This module challenges the foundation of human knowledge. Examining cultural icons from Japan's past and present we will unpack the assumptions, stereotypes, narrative strategies, and visualising techniques of representing Japan. Students will probe one or more of Japan 's three famous cultural icons - the samurai, the geisha, and/or the yakuza - as they appear in literature, visual and performance arts, and academic writings. By the end of the module students will not only have a richer understanding of the “realities” behind such icons, but more significantly, they will be equipped to challenge stereotypes of Japan presented by journalism, popular culture, and the humanistic and social sciences. Ultimately such discovery will lead students to question their own knowledge of self and other. Students should refer to the module IVLE page for details of the selected icon(s) for the current semester. </div></th>

                                    Humans have always actively borrowed from other cultures. Such borrowing is a creative process which influences aspects of life ranging from basic material needs to aesthetic appreciation. Often, however, cultural borrowing is labelled as simple imitation. This results in cultural stereotypes that impede understanding of other cultures. Using Chinese and Japanese cultural borrowings as illustration, this module teaches second and third year students to analyse the creative process of cultural exchange. By developing theoretical perspectives from the study of China and Japan, students will learn about exchanges among culture in general. </div></th>

                              Few words in the English language (or any language) are as evocative and  emotionally-charged as &ldquo;home.&rdquo; But how do we determine what we call home, and  why should we take &ldquo;home&rdquo; seriously? This module explores the political,  social, economic, and cultural aspects of the complex idea of home. Major  topics include: sense of place, home technologies and design, gender and  housework, home and travel, globalisation, nationalism, homelessness, exile,  and representations of home. Students will complete the module with a new  appreciation for the complexity of the places – house, neighbourhood, nation,  planet – they call home.</div></th>

                              Consumption has come to dominate our lives, is driving economies, yet  also endangering the future of our planet. This module asks questions about  consumption from multiple perspectives, such as how did consumption assume its  prominent place, how do economists rationalise consumption, how do companies  use behavioural models to craft marketing strategies, whether consumption is  good or bad for society or the individual, or whether consumers need to be  protected. Participants in this module will explore how different disciplines  approach such questions and will have the opportunity to reflect on their own  consumption practices and impact on the social and physical environment.</div></th>

                                    This module challenges the foundation of human knowledge. Examining cultural icons from Japan's past and present we will unpack the assumptions, stereotypes, narrative strategies, and visualising techniques of representing Japan. Students will probe one or more of Japan 's three famous cultural icons - the samurai, the geisha, and/or the yakuza - as they appear in literature, visual and performance arts, and academic writings. By the end of the module students will not only have a richer understanding of the “realities” behind such icons, but more significantly, they will be equipped to challenge stereotypes of Japan presented by journalism, popular culture, and the humanistic and social sciences. Ultimately such discovery will lead students to question their own knowledge of self and other. Students should refer to the module IVLE page for details of the selected icon(s) for the current semester. </div></th>

                                    Humans have always actively borrowed from other cultures. Such borrowing is a creative process which influences aspects of life ranging from basic material needs to aesthetic appreciation. Often, however, cultural borrowing is labelled as simple imitation. This results in cultural stereotypes that impede understanding of other cultures. Using Chinese and Japanese cultural borrowings as illustration, this module teaches second and third year students to analyse the creative process of cultural exchange. By developing theoretical perspectives from the study of China and Japan, students will learn about exchanges among culture in general. </div></th>

                                    Consumption has come to dominate our lives, is driving economies, yet  also endangering the future of our planet. This module asks questions about  consumption from multiple perspectives, such as how did consumption assume its  prominent place, how do economists rationalise consumption, how do companies  use behavioural models to craft marketing strategies, whether consumption is  good or bad for society or the individual, or whether consumers need to be  protected. Participants in this module will explore how different disciplines  approach such questions and will have the opportunity to reflect on their own  consumption practices and impact on the social and physical environment.</div></th>

                                    Few words in the English language (or any language) are as evocative and  emotionally-charged as &ldquo;home.&rdquo; But how do we determine what we call home, and  why should we take &ldquo;home&rdquo; seriously? This module explores the political,  social, economic, and cultural aspects of the complex idea of home. Major  topics include: sense of place, home technologies and design, gender and  housework, home and travel, globalisation, nationalism, homelessness, exile,  and representations of home. Students will complete the module with a new  appreciation for the complexity of the places – house, neighbourhood, nation,  planet – they call home.</div></th>
